# What's this?

This repository holds notes I made whilst learning OpenID Connect and OAuth 2 whilst implementing an OpenID identity provider (OP) using the brilliant [IdentityServer3](https://github.com/IdentityServer/IdentityServer3)  

# Why a repo?
Well, it dawned on me that the best way to take notes is as Markdown files and push them to github and let them be indexed and made searchable!
